         <p>Our twitter based model is a hybrid model having characteristics of both extractive summarisation and abstractive summarisation. This gives it the power to find information as efficiently as possible whilst also providing a human touch to the tweets generated by virtue of Natural Language Processing tools used in the Neural Network based Abstractive model.

         <p>Modules used for both of the products are modular and are made taking care of the requirement of different Web applications and their respective backends. Both of the type of products are also made of exclusive modularly coded summarisation modules which happen to be broken down and used elsewhere.
